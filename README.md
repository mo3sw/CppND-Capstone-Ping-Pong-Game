# CppND-Capstone-Ping-Pong-Game
This project is the Capstone project for Udacity's C++ NanoDegree program [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

The project is a Ping Pong game between two players. Once you follow the instructions below to compile, build, and run the project, you can start playing imidiately. The game is a black screen with two pallets on the each side of the screen which the player can control and a ball starting in the middle which will start bouncing between the players. Once the ball reaches one of the side it considered as a goal and it will go back to the middle and start again.

* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  * Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source.
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Capstone Project Rubic Points
### Compileing and testing
Markup : - [ ] The project code must compile and run without errors

### Loops, Functions, I/O
Markup : - [ ] A variety of control structures are used in the project. The project code is clearly organized into functions.
